University of Cape Town Final Year Design Course EEE4113F Group 29 penguin protection system. 


There are 3 Sub-Systems:

Detection: Utilizes motion sensors and a camera to detect and capture images of predators, which are then uploaded to the user interface while simultaneously signaling the deterrent system.

Deterrent: Upon detection, triggers auditory and visual deterrents designed to scare predators
away without causing physical harm or environmental damage.

User-Interface: Acts as a communication bridge between the automated system and conservationists, providing researchers with data from the detection and deterrent systems for further analysis.
